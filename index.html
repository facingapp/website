<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Mobile devices are equipped with advanced technology like GPS, Digital Compass &amp; Accelerometers. Somehow, finding your friend in a crowd can seem near impossible... unless you know exactly where to look.  That's where <strong>Facing</strong> comes in.</p>

<p>Combining the technology that already exists in your device, <strong>Facing</strong> intends to help two people find one another, simply &amp; easily.</p>

<p>Not only will you know exactly where to look for your friend, you'll also know if they are facing the right direction to find you.  Once you are both looking at each other, the <strong>Facing</strong> App will quickly flash the LED on the back of your device to help you better find one other.</p>

<a name="example-use-cases" class="anchor" href="#example-use-cases"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example Use Cases</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>You're at a crowded event and you can't find your friend who is looking for you.  If you are both using <strong>Facing</strong> you'll know exactly where to look.</p></li>
<li><p>You and your friend decide to meet up at a place that is half way between the two of you.  Use Facing to find out where that is.</p></li>
<li><p>You're a mobile application developer.  Launch <strong>Facing</strong> using our custom facing:// protocol to allow your users to find one another.</p></li>
