Facing _( a proof of concept )_
===

Introduction
---

Mobile devices are equipped with advanced technology like GPS & digital compases. Somehow, however, finding your friend in a crowd can be near impossible... unless you know exactly where to look.  That's where **Facing** comes in.

Combining technology that already exists in your device, Facing intends to help two people find one another, simply & easily.

Project Goal
---

Facing is a work in progress by a core group of designers and developers. Our initial goal is to make a custom mobile application as a proof of concept to allow device owners to use our application to find any other user that also has our application installed.  The two individuals ( once connected ) will have an intuitive interface to direct them where to look for the person they are trying to find.

Once this proof of concept is launched, we will begin packaging and testing OS specific Frameworks. Developers will be able to use these custom Frameworks in their own applications.


Example Use Cases
---

1. You're at an event and you can't find your friend because you're looking in the wrong direction.  Use Facing with your friend to know exactly which way to look to find one other.

2. You and your friend decide to meet up at a place that is half way between the two of you.  Use Facing to find out where that is.

3. You're a mobile application developer that has a social feature and know some users are talking over long distances.  Help make a stronger emotional connection by allowing them to know they're looking at each other even though they're hundreds of miles apart.
